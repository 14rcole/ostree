* Documentation

* Hybrid SSL pull (fetch refs over SSL, content via plain HTTP)

* ostree-commit: multithreaded/async (basically compute sha256 in parallel)

* GPG signatures on commits

* Tests of corrupted repositories, more error conditions

* Improve GRUB management: Assocate kernels with their deployments

* ostree admin install: Pull in host data, such as uids and /etc/fstab

* ostree admin undeploy <osname> <tree>

* ostree admin uninstall <osname>

* Possibly move all of the "regular" commands to be "ostree repo" ?  Then
  we'd have: "ostree repo pull", "ostree repo ls", etc.
