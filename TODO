* Documentation
  - More gtk-doc

* Local metadata packs
  - Just to avoid lots of little files on each client

* Hybrid SSL pull (fetch refs over SSL, content via plain HTTP)

* ostree-commit: multithreaded/async (basically compute sha256 in parallel)
  - Also speed up devino cache by having a big mmappable file that maps from
    (device, inode) -> checksum.  We need to keep the cache up to to date;
    investigate something like http://www.sqlite.org/wal.html for having
    a shared file.

* Indexed metadata pack objects for bare repositories at least;
  no reason to inflict thousands of little metadata files on
  each client.

* Efficient delta format between commit objects, somewhat like
  Chromium autoupdate: set of operations to perform given previous
  object set to create new objects.

* Flexible "prune" that allows keeping only a rolling subset of history.
  For example, keep the last week, keep at least 1 build a week up
  till a year ago, then 1 build a month, etc.  Optionally rewrite commit
  parent history?

* Tests of corrupted repositories, more error conditions

* Structured output from commandline?  ostree --output={table,gvariant} ?

* Better output on a tty - progress bars

* Improve library

* ostree admin install: Pull in host data, such as uids and /etc/fstab

* ostree admin undeploy <osname> <tree>

* ostree admin uninstall <osname>

* Possibly move all of the "regular" commands to be "ostree repo" ?  Then
  we'd have: "ostree repo pull", "ostree repo ls", etc.
